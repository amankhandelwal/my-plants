# The Plan
I want to create a simple website to showcase my plants. The website would have details around each of the plants that I own. Details include:
- Their names
- Category - Indoor vs Outdoor
- Scientific name
- Plant type - herb, succulent, etc.
- Image Library with a primary image. I could choose to add more images later. For now assume most would have 1 image only
- Details about watering schedule (once a week)
- Fun facts about the plant

# Rules
- All the changes need to be local to the project folder - no changes should be made in the global environment. If you really need to make some changes, I need to give an explicit confirmation. Do not do this unless absolutely necessary
	- this includes node/npm versions
	- environment variables
	- bashrc / zshrc files
- I am a senior software engineer and I want you to act like one as well. All the code needs to be production quality code. Code should be clean, well structured and should follow clear separation of concern. Your code should reflect how a senior engineer would work.
- You are a creative soul. Ideas are always welcome. I need you to think from the perspective of what would make things more appealing. Think along the lines of:
	- Random facts
	- Taglines
	- Making the design beautiful
	- Quotes/Phrases

# Technical Requirements
Let's talk about technical requirements:
- The app should be a react based app
- The app should be responsive (devices to support - 14,15,16 inch laptops, ipad, iphone/any other android phone)
- For now the app is a static Single Page app
- The app should have some sort of navigation to move around
- The app should be hosted on Github pages
- All the data in the app should come from a JSON file. The code should parse this JSON and render the data. It should be a single JSON file (not one per plant).
- Considering this is a react app, I expect you to create clear components
- For each component create a folder and have component specific CSS files with styling for each component only
- Populate the Readme as well
- For any and all 404 requests on my path, route the request to index.html page itself
- Few Images are present in the plants folder

# UI/UX
- The home page should have a list of all my plants similar to "references/Meet my Plants.pdf"
- On clicking on any of the plants, I should be taken to a page with more details about that plant.

# GEMINI's plan
1.  **Project Setup:** I'll start by setting up a new React application in the current directory using `create-react-app`. All dependencies and configurations will be kept local to this project.

2.  **Data Foundation:** I will create a central `plants.json` file. This file will contain all the information about your plants, including their names, categories (Indoor/Outdoor), images, and other details you've specified. I'll use the plant list from your PDF and search for additional details like scientific names and fun facts to make the content more engaging.

3.  **Component-Based Architecture:** I'll structure the application into reusable React components, each with its own dedicated folder and stylesheet. This will include:
    *   A `Header` with a catchy tagline.
    *   A `PlantCard` component to display a preview of each plant on the homepage.
    *   A `PlantDetails` component to show more information when a user clicks on a plant.
    *   A `Footer` with some plant-related quotes.

4.  **Routing and Navigation:** I'll implement routing using `react-router-dom` to create a seamless single-page application experience. This will allow users to navigate from the main plant listing to individual plant detail pages without full page reloads. I'll also configure a 404 redirect to the homepage for any invalid URLs.

5.  **UI/UX and Styling:** I'll design a clean, modern, and responsive UI inspired by your PDF. The design will be mobile-first, ensuring it looks great on all devices. I'll use a nature-inspired color palette and elegant typography to create a visually appealing experience.

6.  **Deployment:** Finally, I'll prepare the application for deployment on GitHub Pages and update the `README.md` with instructions on how to run the project locally and a link to the live site.
