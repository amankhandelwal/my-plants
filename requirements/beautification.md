# The Plan
Okay now that we have a basic skeleton of the website ready, it's time for beautification. The website honestly doesn't look attractive at all. 
1. Let's start with a color palette. These colors remind me of plants. I want you to use these colors wisely. Understand the colors and use them appropriately:
   - #ECE4B7
   - #D9DD92
   - #63CB68
   - #EABE7C
   - #443226
2. Let's also pick appropriate fonts and play around with font sizes. The typography is not that great right now.
3. Let's fix URLs. Currently urls are displayed as hyperlinks with underlines and are blue in color. That's not modern. Use elements like cards and buttons with some shadow.
4. Let's also work on the alignment of things, not everything should be center aligned. I hope you have seen modern websites and how cards are created with details placed
5. Adjust and improve the padding and margin
6. Let's add some emojis/icons as well to the text. It looks really plain right now
7. For Navigation let's use basic breadcrumb / back button to go back to home. I don't want to press Chrome's back button everytime.

# Rules
Refer to the rules mentioned in the GEMINI.md file

# Technical Requirements
Let's talk about technical requirements:
- The app should be responsive (devices to support - 14,15,16 inch laptops, ipad, iphone/any other android phone)
- The app should be hosted on Github pages
- Let's keep the color scheme in a separate file, and use references in our CSS files (let me know if this isn't possible)
- We'll stick to plain CSS, no tailwind / other css libraries
- Each component has component specific CSS files with styling for that component only.

# UI/UX
I have added 2 references: 
- references/sample_website_1.png
- references/sample_website_1.png
References are for inspiration, not to copy exactly. Use them as inspiration and not to clone the style as is

# GEMINI's plan

1.  **Color & Typography Foundation:**
    *   I'll create a central `src/colors.css` file to define your color palette as CSS variables. This will make it easy to manage and reuse your brand colors across the entire application.
    *   I'll import two new fonts from Google Fonts: a classic serif for headings to give them a touch of elegance, and a clean sans-serif for body text to ensure readability. These will be set as the base fonts in `index.css`.

2.  **Component Refinement:**
    *   **Header & Footer:** I'll restyle the header and footer to use the new color scheme and typography, creating a more cohesive and professional look.
    *   **Plant Cards:** I'll redesign the plant cards to be more visually appealing, removing the default hyperlink styling and adding subtle shadows to make them pop. I'll also improve the layout of the text within the cards.
    *   **Plant Details:** I'll revamp the plant details page with a more modern layout, using a two-column design to display the images and text side-by-side on larger screens.

3.  **Enhanced User Experience:**
    *   **Navigation:** I'll add a simple and elegant back button to the plant details page, making it easier for users to navigate back to the homepage.
    *   **Visual Flair:** I'll sprinkle in some relevant emojis and icons to make the content more engaging and visually interesting.
    *   **Responsive Design:** I'll ensure all the new styles are fully responsive, using media queries to create a seamless experience across all devices, from mobile phones to large desktop screens.
