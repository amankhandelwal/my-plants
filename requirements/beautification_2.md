# The Plan
The first attempt at beautification was not that great or polished. It's time for beautification effort #2. The website honestly doesn't look modern.

1. This time I've created sample wireframes for you. Use the wireframes below as references.The wireframes are for Desktop view
   - references/home_page.png
   - references/plant_detail_page.png
2. We'll majorly stick to our original color palette. I've removed one of the old ones.
   - #ECE4B7
   - #D9DD92
   - #EABE7C
   - #443226
3. For the back button, use the icon I used. It's material icon's back button.
4. Fix the Image Gallery. Check the reference Image. Check the UI/UX section below for more details.

# Rules
- Use the References Provided above. The references above are for desktop view. Figure out the mobile view. Ensure we are still responsive
- Ensure the code is running correctly before you push changes.
- Once I've verified everything is working as expected, you can deploy it to our GH page.

# Technical Requirements
Let's talk about technical requirements:
- You don't necessarily need to install Material Icons. You could just stick to downloading one icon. Evaluate and make a call based on how much it would impact package size.
  The app should be responsive (devices to support - 14,15,16 inch laptops, ipad, iphone/any other android phone)
- Let's keep the color scheme in a separate file as we are currently doing, and use references in our CSS files
- We'll stick to plain CSS, no tailwind / other css libraries
- Each component has component specific CSS files with styling for that component only.
- For the Image Gallery, ensure the horizontal scroll works

# UI/UX
I have added 2 references: 
- references/home_page.png
- references/plant_detail_page.png

For the Overall layout of Plant Details page:
- We'll split the page into 2 just like the reference image
  - Left side, we have the Image Gallery
    - Image gallery has a large central image
    - Image gallery has small thumbnails at the bottom. The thumbnails are scrollable and clicking on one changes the image in the Image Gallery. Selected thumbnail should be highlighted in some way.
  - Right side, we have the Plant details

# GEMINI's plan

1.  **Update `beautification_2.md`:** I'll update the `GEMINI's plan` section in `requirements/beautification_2.md` with this detailed plan.
2.  **Refine Color Palette:** I'll update `src/colors.css` to reflect the refined color palette, removing `#D9DD92` and ensuring the remaining colors are correctly defined as CSS variables.
3.  **Header Redesign:**
    *   I'll modify `src/components/Header/Header.js` and `src/components/Header/Header.css` to align with the new wireframe. This will involve adjusting the layout, typography, and color scheme to achieve a modern, clean look.
4.  **Plant Card Redesign (HomePage):**
    *   I'll update `src/components/PlantCard/PlantCard.css` to match the visual style of the home page wireframe. This includes refining the card's appearance with appropriate shadows, rounded corners, and ensuring the plant name and category are displayed clearly with updated typography.
5.  **Plant Details Page Redesign:**
    *   **Back Button:** I'll update `src/pages/PlantDetailsPage/PlantDetailsPage.js` to include a back button with the specified Material Icon. I will use an SVG or Unicode character for the icon to minimize package size impact. I'll also adjust its positioning and styling in `src/pages/PlantDetailsPage/PlantDetailsPage.css` for better alignment with the card.
    *   **Title Color & Alignment:** I'll ensure the plant title color is clearly visible against the background and set the text content to be left-aligned in `src/pages/PlantDetailsPage/PlantDetailsPage.css`.
    *   **Image Gallery:** I'll review and refine the existing `src/components/ImageGallery/ImageGallery.js` and `src/components/ImageGallery/ImageGallery.css` to ensure it fully matches the wireframe's functionality: a prominent main image, horizontally scrollable thumbnails below it, and a clear visual indication for the currently selected thumbnail. I'll specifically ensure the horizontal scroll works as expected.
    *   **Overall Layout:** I'll confirm that the two-column layout (image gallery on the left, plant details on the right) is correctly implemented and responsive across various screen sizes, as per the wireframes and responsiveness requirements.
6.  **General Styling & Responsiveness:**
    *   I'll conduct a comprehensive review of all CSS files (`src/index.css`, `src/App.css`, and component-specific CSS) to adjust padding, margins, and overall alignment, ensuring a cohesive and polished look.
    *   I'll add or refine media queries as needed to guarantee the application is fully responsive on 14, 15, and 16-inch laptops, iPads, and mobile phones.
