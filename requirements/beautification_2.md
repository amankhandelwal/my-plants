# The Plan
The first attempt at beautification was not that great or polished. It's time for beautification effort #2. The website honestly doesn't look modern.

1. This time I've created sample wireframes for you. Use the wireframes below as references.The wireframes are for Desktop view
   - references/home_page.png
   - references/plant_detail_page.png
2. We'll majorly stick to our original color palette. I've removed one of the old ones.
   - #ECE4B7
   - #D9DD92
   - #EABE7C
   - #443226
3. For the back button, use the icon I used. It's material icon's back button.
4. Fix the Image Gallery. Check the reference Image. Check the UI/UX section below for more details.

# Rules
- Use the References Provided above. The references above are for desktop view. Figure out the mobile view. Ensure we are still responsive
- Ensure the code is running correctly before you push changes.

# Technical Requirements
Let's talk about technical requirements:
- You don't necessarily need to install Material Icons. You could just stick to downloading one icon. Evaluate and make a call based on how much it would impact package size.
  The app should be responsive (devices to support - 14,15,16 inch laptops, ipad, iphone/any other android phone)
- Let's keep the color scheme in a separate file as we are currently doing, and use references in our CSS files
- We'll stick to plain CSS, no tailwind / other css libraries
- Each component has component specific CSS files with styling for that component only.
- For the Image Gallery, ensure the horizontal scroll works

# UI/UX
I have added 2 references: 
- references/home_page.png
- references/plant_detail_page.png

For the Overall layout of Plant Details page:
- We'll split the page into 2 just like the reference image
  - Left side, we have the Image Gallery
    - Image gallery has a large central image
    - Image gallery has small thumbnails at the bottom. The thumbnails are scrollable and clicking on one changes the image in the Image Gallery. Selected thumbnail should be highlighted in some way.
  - Right side, we have the Plant details
